The main focus for GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) is to generate data from scratch, mostly images but other domains including music have been done. But the scope of application is far bigger than this. Just like the example below, it generates a zebra from a horse. In reinforcement learning, it helps a robot to learn much faster.
